## üåü What Is This?

**Robinhood HA Breakout** is like having a professional trading assistant that:

- üìä **Watches the market** for you using advanced chart analysis
- üß† **Makes smart decisions** using artificial intelligence
- ü§ñ **Handles the boring stuff** like clicking through Robinhood's interface
- üõ°Ô∏è **Keeps you safe** by never placing trades without your final approval
- üí∞ **Manages your money** responsibly with built-in risk controls

**Think of it as your trading co-pilot** - it does all the heavy lifting, but you're always in the driver's seat for the final decision.

---

## üéØ How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### The Magic Behind the Scenes

1. **üìà Market Analysis**
   - Downloads the latest SPY stock price data
   - Converts regular price charts to "Heikin-Ashi" charts (smoother, clearer trends)
   - Finds important support and resistance levels (like floors and ceilings for the stock price)

2. **ü§ñ AI Decision Making**
   - Sends all the market data to an AI (like ChatGPT)
   - The AI analyzes patterns and decides: "Buy a Call", "Buy a Put", or "Do Nothing"
   - Provides confidence levels and reasoning for each decision

3. **üí∞ Money Management**
   - Calculates how much money to risk based on your account size
   - Tracks all your trades and profits/losses
   - Never risks more than you can afford to lose

4. **üåê Browser Automation**
   - Opens Chrome and logs into your Robinhood account
   - Navigates to the options trading page
   - Fills out the trade details automatically
   - **STOPS at the final "Submit" button** - you decide whether to click it!

### üîÑ Two Ways to Use It

#### üéØ **One-Shot Mode** (Traditional)
- Run once, get one trade recommendation
- Perfect for manual trading sessions
- You control exactly when it runs

#### üîÑ **Continuous Loop Mode** (NEW!)
- Runs automatically every few minutes
- Monitors the market all morning
- Sends you notifications when opportunities arise
- Automatically stops at a time you set

## üéÆ How to Use It

### üß™ Test Mode (Start Here!)

**Always test first!** This mode analyzes the market but doesn't open your browser:

```bash
python main.py --dry-run
```

**What you'll see:**
- Market analysis results
- AI's trading decision and reasoning
- Risk calculations
- No browser automation

### üéØ One-Shot Trading Mode

**For single trade sessions:**

```bash
python main.py
```

**What happens:**
1. Analyzes current market conditions
2. Gets AI recommendation
3. Opens Chrome and logs into Robinhood
4. Navigates to the options page
5. Fills out the trade details
6. **Stops at the Review screen** - you decide whether to submit!

### üîÑ Continuous Loop Mode (NEW!)

**For automated morning scanning:**

```bash
# Basic loop - checks every 5 minutes
python main.py --loop

# Custom interval - checks every 3 minutes
python main.py --loop --interval 3

# Stop at specific time - ends at 12:00 PM
python main.py --loop --interval 5 --end-at 12:00

# With Slack notifications
python main.py --loop --interval 5 --end-at 12:00 --slack-notify
```

**What happens in loop mode:**
- Runs continuously until you stop it (Ctrl+C) or reach the end time
- Checks the market every few minutes
- Sends "heartbeat" messages when there's no trade opportunity
- When it finds a good trade, it prepares everything and notifies you
- Keeps the browser open between checks (more efficient)
- Automatically restarts the browser if it's been idle for 4+ hours

### üìä Position Monitoring Mode (NEW!)

**Automated real-time position tracking with profit/loss alerts:**

```bash
# Enhanced monitoring with Alpaca real-time data
python monitor_alpaca.py

# Integrated monitoring mode
python main.py --monitor-positions

# Custom monitoring intervals
python main.py --monitor-positions --interval 1  # Every 1 minute
```

**What position monitoring does:**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time P&L tracking** using Alpaca professional market data
- ‚úÖ **Multi-level profit alerts** at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% gains
- ‚úÖ **Stop-loss protection** alerts at 25% loss threshold
- ‚úÖ **End-of-day warnings** to close positions by 3:45 PM ET
- ‚úÖ **Mobile Slack notifications** for all alerts
- ‚úÖ **1-minute monitoring intervals** for maximum responsiveness
- ‚úÖ **Automatic fallback** to Yahoo Finance if Alpaca unavailable

**Complete monitoring workflow:**

1. **Start your trading session:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --loop --interval 5 --end-at 15:45 --slack-notify
   ```

2. **When you get a position, start monitoring:**
   ```bash
   python monitor_alpaca.py  # In a separate terminal
   ```

3. **Get mobile alerts for:**
   - üéØ **Profit targets hit** (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%+)
   - üõë **Stop loss triggered** (25% loss protection)
   - ‚è∞ **End-of-day warnings** (close by 3:45 PM ET)

**Example monitoring output:**
```
[MONITOR] SPY $628.0 CALL: $1.83 (+28.9%)
[ALERT] Profit target 25% hit for SPY $628.0 CALL
[SLACK] Mobile notification sent
```

**Data quality advantage:**
- Uses **Alpaca real-time data** (same quality as professional traders)
- No more **15-20 minute delays** that cause missed opportunities
- **Professional option price estimation** using current volatility
- **Same data quality** that enabled your +28.9% manual profit

---

## üìä Understanding the Output

### What the AI Tells You

```
[DECISION] LLM Decision: CALL (confidence: 0.72)
[REASON] Strong bullish breakout above $634 resistance with high volume
```

**Translation**: The AI thinks you should buy a Call option because the stock price broke above an important resistance level with strong buying pressure. It's 72% confident in this decision.

### Market Analysis Example

```
[MARKET] Market analysis: BULLISH trend, price $635.42, body 0.45%
```

**Translation**: The overall trend is bullish (upward), SPY is currently at $635.42, and the latest candle has a 0.45% body size (indicating moderate momentum).

### Risk Calculations

```
[BANKROLL] Current bankroll: $1000.00
[POSITION] Position size: $20.00 (2.0% risk)
```

**Translation**: You have $1,000 to trade with, and this trade will risk $20 (2% of your capital).

*Happy Trading! üìà*

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Chrome 120+** (ChromeDriver handled automatically)
- **Robinhood account** with MFA enabled
- **LLM API key**: OpenAI or DeepSeek

### Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd robinhood-ha-breakout

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the environment template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your credentials:
```bash
# Robinhood Credentials
RH_USER=your_email@example.com
RH_PASS=your_password_here

# LLM API Key (choose one)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here
# OR
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key_here
```

### First Run

```bash
# Test with dry run (no browser automation)
python main.py --dry-run

# Full run (opens browser, requires MFA)
python main.py
```

## üìã How It Works

### 1. Market Data Analysis
- Fetches 5-minute SPY candles via yfinance
- Converts to Heikin-Ashi for smoother trend analysis
- Identifies support/resistance levels using pivot points
- Calculates volatility metrics (True Range)

### 2. LLM Decision Making
The LLM receives compact market data and returns a structured decision:

```json
{
  "decision": "CALL|PUT|NO_TRADE",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "reason": "Strong bullish breakout with volume confirmation"
}
```

**Decision Rules:**
- Confidence calibrated against recent 20-trade win rate
- Low volatility (TR < 40%) reduces confidence by 0.15
- Small candle bodies (< 0.30% of price) trigger NO_TRADE
- Room to next pivot ‚â• 0.5% boosts confidence by 0.10
- High IV (> 45%) halves confidence
- Confidence < 0.35 overrides to NO_TRADE

### 3. Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Fixed quantity or dynamic based on bankroll percentage
- **Risk Validation**: Blocks trades exceeding 50% of bankroll
- **Bankroll Tracking**: Maintains running P/L and performance metrics

### 4. Browser Automation
- Launches undetected Chrome to avoid bot detection
- Logs into Robinhood with manual MFA approval
- Navigates to SPY options chain
- Selects nearest-expiry ATM contract
- Pre-fills order and **STOPS at Review screen**

### 5. Manual Review
You decide whether to:
- ‚úÖ Click "Submit" to execute the trade
- ‚ùå Cancel if you disagree with the analysis
- üîÑ Request similar trade suggestions

## üè¶ Bankroll Management

### Initial Setup
- **Start Capital**: $40 (configurable in `config.yaml`)
- **Risk Fraction**: 50% max per trade (configurable)
- **Size Rules**: 
  - `fixed-qty`: Always trade 1 contract (default)
  - `dynamic-qty`: Size based on risk percentage

### Position Sizing Examples

**Fixed Quantity (default):**
```yaml
SIZE_RULE: "fixed-qty"
CONTRACT_QTY: 1
```
- Always trades 1 contract
- Blocks trade if premium > 50% of bankroll

**Dynamic Quantity:**
```yaml
SIZE_RULE: "dynamic-qty" 
RISK_FRACTION: 0.30  # Risk 30% of bankroll
```
- If bankroll = $100, risk = $30
- If option premium = $5, trade 6 contracts ($30 √∑ $5)
- If option premium = $40, trade 1 contract (minimum)

## üìñ Detailed Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

   python record_trade_outcome.py stats
   ```

### Configuration Examples

#### Conservative Setup
```yaml
# config.yaml
START_CAPITAL: 40.0
RISK_FRACTION: 0.25          # Risk only 25% per trade
SIZE_RULE: "fixed-qty"
CONTRACT_QTY: 1
MIN_CONFIDENCE: 0.50         # Higher confidence threshold
MIN_CANDLE_BODY_PCT: 0.20    # Larger breakouts only
```

#### Aggressive Setup
```yaml
# config.yaml
START_CAPITAL: 100.0
RISK_FRACTION: 0.50          # Risk up to 50% per trade
SIZE_RULE: "dynamic-qty"     # Size based on bankroll
MIN_CONFIDENCE: 0.35         # Lower confidence threshold
MIN_CANDLE_BODY_PCT: 0.10    # Smaller breakouts accepted
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "No Trade Signal"
```
[DECISION] LLM Decision: NO_TRADE (confidence: 0.00)
[REASON] Reason: Candle body < 0.1% of price
```
**Solutions:**
- Lower `MIN_CANDLE_BODY_PCT` in config.yaml
- Wait for more volatile market conditions
- Check if `MIN_CONFIDENCE` is too high

#### "Risk Limit Exceeded"
```
WARNING - Fixed quantity $40.00 exceeds risk limit $20.00
```
**Solutions:**
- Increase `RISK_FRACTION` in config.yaml
- Switch to `SIZE_RULE: "dynamic-qty"`
- Wait for cheaper options

#### Browser Issues
- **MFA Timeout**: Approve MFA notification quickly
- **Login Failed**: Check RH_USER/RH_PASS in .env
- **Page Load Error**: Increase `PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT` in config.yaml

### Safety Reminders

#### ‚úÖ What the System Does
- Analyzes market data objectively
- Navigates to Review screen automatically
- Tracks positions and P/L accurately
- Enforces risk management rules
- Provides detailed logging

#### ‚ùå What the System Never Does
- **Auto-submit orders** (always stops at Review)
- **Trade without your approval**
- **Override your manual decisions**
- **Access your funds directly**
- **Make guarantees about profitability**

#### üõ°Ô∏è Your Responsibilities
- **Review every trade** before submitting
- **Understand the risks** of options trading
- **Never trade more** than you can afford to lose
- **Keep credentials secure** (.env file permissions)
- **Monitor positions** regularly
- **Record outcomes** for system learning

### Performance Optimization

#### LLM Confidence Calibration
The system learns from your trade outcomes:
- **Win Rate Tracking**: Last 20 trades influence confidence
- **Confidence Formula**: `confidence = wins_last20 / 20` (capped at 50%)
- **Regular Recording**: Use `record_trade_outcome.py` consistently

#### Position Management
- **Daily Review**: Check `manage_positions.py list` each morning
- **Clean Ledger**: Remove old positions that were closed externally
- **Accurate Fills**: Enter precise fill prices for accurate P/L

#### Market Timing
- **Best Hours**: 9:30-11:00 AM and 2:00-4:00 PM ET
- **Avoid**: First 15 minutes after open, last 15 minutes before close
- **High Volume**: Look for volume confirmation in breakouts

### Bankroll Updates
The LLM can suggest bankroll updates after significant P/L (>5% change):

```json
{
  "new_bankroll": 45.0,
  "reason": "Successful trade increased bankroll by 12.5%"
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize behavior:

```yaml
# Trading Parameters
CONTRACT_QTY: 1
LOOKBACK_BARS: 20
MODEL: "gpt-4o-mini"  # or "deepseek-chat"

# Bankroll Management  
START_CAPITAL: 40.0
RISK_FRACTION: 0.50
SIZE_RULE: "fixed-qty"  # or "dynamic-qty"

# Risk Controls
MAX_PREMIUM_PCT: 0.50    # Max 50% of bankroll per trade
MIN_CONFIDENCE: 0.35     # Minimum LLM confidence to trade
IV_THRESHOLD: 45.0       # High IV threshold

# Browser Settings
HEADLESS: false          # Set true for headless mode
IMPLICIT_WAIT: 10        # Selenium wait time
```

## üìä Logging & Monitoring

### Trade Log (`logs/trade_log.csv`)
Every decision is logged with:
- Timestamp, symbol, decision, confidence
- Market conditions (price, volatility, trend)
- Trade details (strike, premium, quantity)
- Bankroll before/after
- Realized P/L (when trade is closed)

### Bankroll File (`bankroll.json`)
Tracks:
- Current bankroll and total P/L
- Trade history with full details
- Performance metrics (win rate, max drawdown)
- Peak bankroll and drawdown tracking

### Application Logs (`logs/app.log`)
Technical logs for debugging:
- Market data fetch results
- LLM API calls and responses
- Browser automation steps
- Error handling and warnings

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=utils --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_data.py -v

# Run dry-run test
python main.py --dry-run
```

**Test Coverage**: ‚â•90% for all utility modules

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

Build and run in a container:

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t robinhood-ha-breakout .

# Run interactively (required for MFA)
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  -v $(pwd)/bankroll.json:/app/bankroll.json \
  robinhood-ha-breakout

# Run dry-run in container
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env \
  robinhood-ha-breakout --dry-run
```

## üîí Security & Risk

### Security Measures
- ‚úÖ Credentials stored in `.env` (never committed)
- ‚úÖ Undetected ChromeDriver reduces bot detection
- ‚úÖ Manual MFA approval required
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in code

### Risk Controls
- ‚úÖ **NEVER auto-submits orders** - always requires manual Review
- ‚úÖ Position size validation against bankroll
- ‚úÖ Confidence thresholds block low-probability trades  
- ‚úÖ Maximum 1 contract until proven strategy
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for audit trail

### Compliance Notes
- üìã **Personal use only** - not for redistribution
- üìã **Educational/learning purposes**
- üìã **Manual oversight required** - never runs fully automated
- üìã **Respects Robinhood ToS** - no high-frequency or unattended trading

## üìÖ Scheduling (Optional)

### Windows Task Scheduler
Create a task to run weekday mornings:
```batch
# Command
python C:\path\to\robinhood-ha-breakout\main.py

# Working Directory  
C:\path\to\robinhood-ha-breakout

# Schedule: Daily at 9:35 AM, weekdays only
```

### Linux/macOS Cron
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add line (runs at 9:35 AM weekdays)
35 9 * * 1-5 cd /path/to/robinhood-ha-breakout && source .venv/bin/activate && python main.py
```

## üéõÔ∏è Command Line Options

```bash
# Basic run
python main.py

# Dry run (analysis only, no browser)
python main.py --dry-run

# Custom config file
python main.py --config custom_config.yaml

# Debug logging
python main.py --log-level DEBUG

# Help
python main.py --help
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No data returned for SPY"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify yfinance is working: `python -c "import yfinance; print(yfinance.Ticker('SPY').history(period='1d'))"`

**"OPENAI_API_KEY required"**
- Ensure `.env` file exists and contains valid API key
- Check API key has sufficient credits

**"Login failed"**
- Verify Robinhood credentials in `.env`
- Ensure MFA is enabled on account
- Try logging in manually first to check for account issues

**"Could not find ATM option"**
- Market might be closed
- Options chain might not be loaded
- Try running during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

**Browser detection issues**
- Update Chrome to latest version
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try running with `--headless false` in config

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
python main.py --log-level DEBUG

# Check logs
tail -f logs/app.log
```

## üìà Performance Tracking

Monitor your strategy performance:

```python
# View bankroll summary
from utils.bankroll import BankrollManager
manager = BankrollManager()
summary = manager.get_performance_summary()
print(f"Win Rate: {summary['win_rate_pct']:.1f}%")
print(f"Total Return: {summary['total_return_pct']:.1f}%")
```

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Win Rate**: Target >60% for profitable strategy
- **Average Return per Trade**: Should exceed commission costs
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Keep below 20% of peak bankroll
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Calculate from daily returns for risk-adjusted performance
