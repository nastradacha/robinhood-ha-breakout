# 🏗️ Robinhood HA Breakout - System Architecture

**Understanding How Your Multi-Symbol Trading Assistant Works**

*A non-technical guide to the system's design and components*

---

## 🎯 Overview: The Big Picture

Think of the Robinhood HA Breakout system like a **smart factory** that processes market information from multiple sources and produces prioritized trading recommendations. Here's how the "factory" works:

```
📊 Multi-Symbol Data → 🧠 AI Analysis → 🎯 Opportunity Ranking → 💰 Risk Check → 🌐 Browser Action → ✋ Your Decision
     (SPY, QQQ, IWM)      (Concurrent)        (Best First)         (Conservative)        (Manual Review)
```

**New in v0.9.0**: The system now operates like a **professional trading desk** with multi-broker support and enhanced intelligence:
- **🏦 Multi-Broker Support**: Alpaca paper/live trading alongside Robinhood automation
- **🔒 Environment Isolation**: Separate bankroll ledgers and trade logs per broker/environment
- **🛡️ Safety Interlocks**: Explicit live trading acknowledgment with automatic paper fallback
- **📊 Environment Tagging**: All Slack notifications tagged with [PAPER]/[LIVE]/[RH]
- **Enhanced LLM Decision Engine** with 4 professional-grade market analysis features
- **Context Memory System** that learns from recent trades and adapts strategy
- **Robust Data Infrastructure** with automatic fallback for 99.9% uptime
- **Concurrent scanning** of multiple symbols (SPY, QQQ, IWM)
- **Real-time data feeds** from professional sources (Alpaca → Yahoo fallback)
- **Intelligent prioritization** of the best opportunities
- **Enhanced monitoring** with automated position tracking
- **Mobile-first alerts** via Slack with rich charts

Each step has specific "workers" (software components) that handle different parts of the process, just like different departments in a company.
