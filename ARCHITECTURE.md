# üèóÔ∏è Robinhood HA Breakout - System Architecture

**Understanding How Your Multi-Symbol Trading Assistant Works**

*A non-technical guide to the system's design and components*

---

## üéØ Overview: The Big Picture

Think of the Robinhood HA Breakout system like a **smart factory** that processes market information from multiple sources and produces prioritized trading recommendations. Here's how the "factory" works:

```
üìä Multi-Symbol Data ‚Üí üß† AI Analysis ‚Üí üéØ Opportunity Ranking ‚Üí üí∞ Risk Check ‚Üí üåê Browser Action ‚Üí ‚úã Your Decision
     (SPY, QQQ, IWM)      (Concurrent)        (Best First)         (Conservative)        (Manual Review)
```

**New in v2.1.0**: The system now operates like a **multi-line production facility**:
- **Concurrent scanning** of multiple symbols (SPY, QQQ, IWM)
- **Real-time data feeds** from professional sources (Alpaca)
- **Intelligent prioritization** of the best opportunities
- **Enhanced monitoring** with automated position tracking
- **Mobile-first alerts** via Slack with rich charts

Each step has specific "workers" (software components) that handle different parts of the process, just like different departments in a company.
