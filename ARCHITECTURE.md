## 🚨 VIX-Adjusted Position Sizing (US-FA-006)

### **Dynamic Risk Management Based on Market Volatility**

The VIX-Adjusted Position Sizing system automatically reduces position sizes during periods of high market volatility, providing an additional layer of risk protection beyond traditional position sizing rules.

**Key Components:**

1. **📊 VIX Data Integration** (`utils/vix_monitor.py`)
   - Real-time VIX data from Yahoo Finance
   - Cached data with 5-minute refresh intervals
   - Automatic fallback handling for data unavailability

2. **🎯 Position Size Calculator** (`utils/vix_position_sizing.py`)
   - **VIX < 20**: Normal position sizing (100%)
   - **VIX 20-25**: Normal position sizing (100%)
   - **VIX 25-35**: Moderate reduction (50% of normal size)
   - **VIX > 35**: High reduction (25% of normal size)

3. **🔗 Bankroll Integration** (`utils/bankroll.py`)
   - Seamless integration with existing position sizing logic
   - VIX adjustment applied after base position calculation
   - Symbol-aware sizing for future enhancements

4. **📊 Enhanced Logging** (`utils/logging_utils.py`, `utils/portfolio.py`)
   - VIX level recorded with each trade
   - Adjustment factor and volatility regime logged
   - Complete audit trail for performance analysis

5. **📱 Slack Alerts** (`utils/enhanced_slack.py`)
   - Regime change notifications (NORMAL → MODERATE → HIGH)
   - VIX spike alerts with current levels
   - Normalization alerts when volatility subsides

**Configuration Options:**
```yaml
VIX_POSITION_SIZING_ENABLED: true
VIX_NORMAL_THRESHOLD: 20.0
VIX_MODERATE_THRESHOLD: 25.0
VIX_HIGH_THRESHOLD: 35.0
VIX_MODERATE_REDUCTION: 0.5  # 50% reduction
VIX_HIGH_REDUCTION: 0.25     # 75% reduction
VIX_ALERT_ON_REGIME_CHANGE: true
```

**Benefits:**
- **Automatic Risk Reduction**: Smaller positions during volatile markets
- **Transparent Operation**: All adjustments logged and reported
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customizable volatility levels and reductions
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Immediate alerts on regime changes
- **Backward Compatible**: Can be disabled without affecting existing functionality
