# 🏗️ Robinhood HA Breakout - System Architecture

**Understanding How Your Trading Assistant Works**

*A non-technical guide to the system's design and components*

---

## 🎯 Overview: The Big Picture

Think of the Robinhood HA Breakout system like a **smart factory** that processes market information and produces trading recommendations. Here's how the "factory" works:

```
📊 Market Data → 🧠 AI Analysis → 💰 Risk Check → 🌐 Browser Action → ✋ Your Decision
```

Each step has specific "workers" (software components) that handle different parts of the process, just like different departments in a company.

## 🏢 System Components (The "Departments")

### 1. 📈 **Data Department** (`utils/data.py` + `utils/alpaca_client.py`)
**What it does**: Collects and prepares market information with professional-grade data quality

**Think of it as**: Your research team with access to Wall Street-quality data feeds
- **Primary**: Real-time data from Alpaca Markets (professional-grade)
- **Fallback**: Yahoo Finance data (15-20 minute delays)
- Converts regular price charts to smoother "Heikin-Ashi" charts
- Finds important price levels (support and resistance)
- Packages everything into a neat report for the AI

**Key Functions**:
- `fetch_market_data()`: Downloads real-time stock prices (Alpaca → Yahoo fallback)
- `get_current_price()`: Gets real-time current price for analysis
- `calculate_heikin_ashi()`: Makes charts easier to read
- `analyze_breakout_pattern()`: Identifies trading opportunities

**Alpaca Integration** (`utils/alpaca_client.py`):
- `AlpacaClient()`: Professional market data client
